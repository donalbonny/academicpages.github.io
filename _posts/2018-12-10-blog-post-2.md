This is the example of using machine learning in predicting the specific genes in flower developments. 
The original data belongs to Chen et al., 2017

 
======

* Project 1: using caret in R for machine learning and apply into "Modeling Transcription binding contribution and gene expression". I use the random forest algorithm to build the model to predict potential regulators affect domain specificity based on the expression changes between 2 floral specific organs (classify genes in different flower organs including petals, sepals, carpels and stamens). Code can be [found here](https://github.com/donalbonny/MachineLearning_projects/blob/master/flower_model.Rmd)
This is for practicing machine learning model, not for research purpose.
