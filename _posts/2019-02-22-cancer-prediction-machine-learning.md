I found this [blog](https://shiring.github.io/machine_learning/2017/03/31/webinar_code) when searching for cancer datasets and she used the same dataset that I used for machine learning project and application of machine learning in cancer and diease prediction

 This page is overview of [cancer genomics](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/cancer-genomics-overview)

What I have learned from this blog:

- impute missing data using mice package 

-  PCA analysis 

- using regression, classification to build the model (caret package)


I found the Pan-lung cancer dataset from cbio-portal with very nice [data visualization](https://www.cbioportal.org/study?id=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016&tab=summary) of lung cancer data




Example of the most 10 mutation genes and frequency
