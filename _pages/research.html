I am interested in how plants sense, interpret and respond to environmental light conditions. 
Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, molecular and functional genomic approaches, I am trying to understand the regulatory mechanisms of key negative regulators in light signal transduction in Arabidopsis. 
In addition, I am also fascinated by computational biology for the analysis of transcriptomic changes in order to understand the light-triggered gene expression network.

My future research interest is applying machine learning and data analysis in functional genomics to understand the biological system.
