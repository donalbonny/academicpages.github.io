Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Enamul Huq, [Plant Biology Graduate Program at UT](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/huq/home)

## Current projects

My research interests focus on applying both molecular genetics and bioinformatics to understand the light signaling in Arabidopsis.

• Project 1: Applied negative binomial generalized linear models for different expression comparison and
clustering analysis (k-means and hierarchical clustering) in R using gene expression data to reveal intricate
network of developmental pathways regulated by key regulators in Arabidopsis.

• Project 2: Develop computational pipelines using Unix/R and statistical based methods using R to analyze coexpression data from 60 different transcriptome sequencing samples to understand transcriptional regulatory network in light signaling and identify the novel key regulators in light response.

• Project 3: Apply machine learning based gene regulatory networks analysis methods (mlDNA/random forest)
using R and Python combined with large sequencing datasets in Arabidopsis to identify the light signaling novel
related genes based on expression characteristics patterns.

## Future research 

I would like to focus on functional genomics analysis and apply this towards researching cancer and human diseases. 
My ultimate goal is to build a solid knowledge and experience in computational skills as they relate to understanding genetic variants, especially the effects of genomic variants on gene function and signaling networks. 
Ultimately, I seek to develop innovative methods with human genomics data.
