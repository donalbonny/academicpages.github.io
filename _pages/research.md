Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Enamul Huq, [Plant Biology Graduate Program at UT](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/huq/home)

## Current projects

During my first two years, my research focused on elucidating the protein-protein interaction and also ubiquitination/degradation and phosphorylation of key repressors in light signaling in Arabidopsis.

Since my second year, I have developed my computational skills by focusing on gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing and co-expression analysis.
However, my aim is to study gene regulatory network by genetic variations to acquire a more holistic view of the regulatory network in plants. 
Therefore, I am now trying to build the network-based expression analysis of genetic/epigenetic variations. 

Using co-expression analysis (WGCNA) and RNA-seq datasets from different light treatments and key regulatory mutants in light signaling pathway, my goal is to build the network-based gene expression profile, the role of alternative splicing, and to identify the novel target genes associated with light signaling.
Further, I seek to elucidate the fundamental questions underlying genotype-phenotype relationships. 

## Future research 

I would like to focus on functional genomics analysis and apply this towards researching cancer and human diseases. 

My ultimate goal is to build a solid knowledge and experience in computational skills as they relate to understanding genetic variants, especially the effects of genomic variants on gene function and signaling networks. 
Ultimately, I seek to develop innovative methods with human genomics data.
