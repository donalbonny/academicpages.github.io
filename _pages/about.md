A research-minded, passion for data analysis and dedicated for education
======

Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Enamul Huq, Plant Biology Graduate Program at UT. During my first two years, my research focused on elucidating the protein-protein interaction and also ubiquitination/ degradation and phosphorylation of key repressors in light signaling in Arabidopsis. 
From my third year, I have developed my computational skills by focusing on gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing and co-expression analysis. However, my aim is to study gene regulatory network by genetic variations to get the big picture of the regulatory network in plants. 
Therefore, I am now trying to build the network-based expression analysis on genetic/epigenetic variations. Using WGCNA analysis and RNA-seq datasets from different light treatments and key regulatory mutants in light signaling pathway, my goal is building the network-based gene expression profile, the role of alternative splicing and identify the novel target genes associated with light signaling and elucidate the fundamental questions underlying genotype-phenotype relationships. 


In future, I would like to focus on functional genomics analysis and applying in cancer and human diseases. My ultimate goal is building my solid knowledge and experience in my computational skills by understanding cancer genetics variants, especially the effects of genomic variants on gene function and signaling networks. 

I have a passionate curiosity and drive for working with the problems through data and science. I am a hard working, self-motivated, academically accomplished person with the ability to work well in a dynamic team and a desire for learning.
