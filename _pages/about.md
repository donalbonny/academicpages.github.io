A research-minded, passion for data analysis and dedicated for education
======

I am a Ph.D. student with the strong foundations in molecular genetics, computational genomics and research experience in next-generation sequencing data analysis. 

My future research interest is applying machine learning, data analysis and modeling in cancer genomics analysis and human diseases. 

I have a passionate curiosity and drive for working with the problems through data and science. I am a hard working, self-motivated, academically accomplished person with the ability to work well in a dynamic team, a desire for learning and a strong passion for teaching.
